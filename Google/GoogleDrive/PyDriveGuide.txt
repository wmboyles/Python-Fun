##########   PyDrive GUIDE   ##########

1) If PyDrive isn't already installed, do [pip install PyDrive]
	a) You probably want to give sudo access

2) Go the the APIs Consle here: https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/projects
	a) and create a project
	b) Search for 'Google Drive API', select the entry, and click 'Enable'
	c) Select 'Credentials' from the left menu

	c) Put [http://localhost:8080] for 'Authorized JavaScript origins'
	d) Put [http://localhost:8080/] for 'Authorized redirect URI's' (remember the /)
	e) Click 'Save' or 'Create'

6) On the right-hand side of the credential listing:
	a) Click 'Download JSON' (it's a download symbol)

### HOW TO UPLOAD A SINGLE FILE TO A SPECIFIED FOLDER ###
1) Create a python file in the same folder as 'client_secrets.json'

2) Write: [
	from pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth
	from pydrive.drive import GoogleDrive
	
	gauth = GoogleAuth()
	gauth.LocalWebserverAuth()
	
	drive = GoogleDrive(gauth)
	]

3) In the web-version of Google Drive, create a folder where you will upload stuff

4) Append to code and Run: [
	file_list = drive.ListFile({'q': "'root' in parents and trashed=false"}).GetList()
    	for file1 in file_list:       
    	print 'title: %s, id: %s' % (file1['title'], file1['id'])
	]

5) Select the id of the folder you just created and copy it
	a) it'll look something like: [id1NZoUlDlJd3HHg4yQeOsTdzGXXlaOtNta]

6) Remove: [
	file_list = drive.ListFile({'q': "'root' in parents and trashed=false"}).GetList()
    	for file1 in file_list:       
    	print 'title: %s, id: %s' % (file1['title'], file1['id'])
	]

7) Write: [fid = 'COPIED FOLDER ID']
	a) That'll look like: [fid = 'id1NZoUlDlJd3HHg4yQeOsTdzGXXlaOtNta']

8) Write: [
	file = drive.CreateFile({"parents": [{"kind": "drive#fileLink", "id": fid}]})
	file.SetContentFile('SOME LOCAL PATH TO A FILE YOU WANT TO UPLOAD')
	file.Upload()
	]
	a) You'll have to use '\\' to specifiy a backslash (UniCode Escape)
9) When this is ran, it will upload the specified file to the specified folder



### HOW TO CREATE SUBFOLDER(S) ###

1) If you don't already have this, write: [
	from pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth
	from pydrive.drive import GoogleDrive

	gauth = GoogleAuth()
	gauth.LocalWebserverAuth()

	drive = GoogleDrive(gauth)
	]

2) If need to know the parent folder id, write: [
	file_list = drive.ListFile({'q': "'root' in parents and trashed=false"}).GetList()
	for file in file_list:
		print("Name: %s, ID: %s'%(file['title'],file['id']))
	]

3) Copy the folder ID and write: [
	fid = 'COPIED FOLDER ID'
	]

4) To create the metadata for a new folder, write: [
	new_folder_metadata = {
		'title': 'NEW FOLDER NAME',
    		'mimeType': 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder',
    		'parents': [{'kind': 'drive#fileLink', 'id': fid}]
    	}

	folder = drive.CreateFile(folder_metadata)
	folder.Upload()
	]
